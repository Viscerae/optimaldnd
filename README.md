# Optimal DND

Author: Viscera

## This project has the following objectives:

‚úß Build tools, wether they are in html on a website hosted through github pages or executables that are downloadable from here or my website.

‚úß These said tools will be aimed at both Dungeon Masters and Players

‚úß The aim of this project should be to alleviate most of the DM's and Players workload while keeping track of status and Health, with some more functions that should be implemented along the way (I'll figure it out later)

‚úß Another objective I have is to make this both free and accessible, though donations will be available and you can support me if you wish to do so.

‚úß Finally the intended use for these tools will be mainly at the tabletop as an aid do the DM and PCs but you could try and use them online if you play using other tools like Roll20, I dont know how much this will help you there but give it a try and send me some feedback.

## As a last note:

‚úß Thank you in advance for any help and code corrections you send my way.

‚úß Every bit of feedback is appreciated and helpful, feel free to hit me up on here and tell me how shit my code is and how you would improve it.

‚úß Thanks to anyone who follows this page and uses these tools, lets make DnD easier for everyone.
